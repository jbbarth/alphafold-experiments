Alphafold Experiments
=====================

This repository stores some experiments with Alphafold3 from Deepmind.

Install
-------

The core is a typical Rails app. You need to install ruby 3.3.x (I recommend https://rvm.io/, ymmv) and then the typical `bundle`. Learning Rails is beyond the scope of this README.

For deployment you can use a PaaS like Heroku or Fly.io.
